APPLICATION AND BENCHMARK CREATION

createresults.py:
	Creates and runs some benchmarking applications and stores their results in a file.
	It prints status messages on stdout and uses runbench.py for application generation.
	(Currently by invoking "runbench.py 10 64 128"). For parallel runs, each process
	requires its own source directory. The result file contains the consecutive information
	about the applications that was given by runbench.py and the serial output of each
	application which consists of the amount of Checksum calculation runs and interruptions.

	Arguments: builddir outputfile number

	builddir: The directory used for building the applications (will be wiped!)
	outputfile: The file in which the results are stored
	number: The number of applications benchmarked

	Output format:
		seed: [...]
		repetitions: [...]
		[...]
		standard_deviation_of_waiting_durations: [...]
		<number of interruptions>/<number of checksum calculations>

runbench.py:
	Creates an benchmarking application in /app/bcc1/depbench called bcc1_depbench. Some
	statistical values are printed on stdout. In contrary to its name, no application will
	be run!

	Arguments: repetitions slots objects [seed]
	
	repetitions: The number of times the main loop is repeated
	slots: The number of slots used to distritbute CheckedObjects
	objects: The number of objects created in the application
	seed: Optional parameter - if given it is used as the seed for the python random
			number generator.
